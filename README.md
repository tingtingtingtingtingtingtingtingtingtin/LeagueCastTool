# LeagueCastTool

Takes in Champion Names (Case Sensitive and really specific :) and parse's through League's API for data
Currently only outputs ability names, but back-end supports images and relavent game data(Cooldowns, CC durations)

We used body-parser to parse the JSON, express for the web server, and EJS for the template

run `npm install` for dependencies

To run program use`node server.js`
